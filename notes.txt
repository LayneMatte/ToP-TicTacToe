    - 2d array 3x3 grid = 9squares 
    - 2 players - one has an X token, the other has a O token 
    - all cells are empty at beginning 
    - First player inputs their token 
    - players switch off inputting their token into the grid 
    - when one player ends up with 3 in a row (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) they win.
